#R_Project_monitoring_ecosystems
#climate change is acting as fast modification in the ecosystems.
#Higher temperatures are melting the snow and giving more space to the vegetation to grow direction north.
#The albedo of the snow is higher then the one of the grass that is higher than the one of the trees
#We would expect, during the years, a reduction in the albedo, with a progressively movement of the line of the vegetation going towards the Arctic
